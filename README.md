# Euler
Work in C++, Java, and OpenCL to solve the first 40 Project Euler problems

I worked on this as part of my thesis in Computer Science. I was comparing runtimes of general problem sets for simple and optimized solutions in the three languages above. I largely wanted to see if OpenCL (or CUDA) could be used to solve a general problem set in similar times to C++ or Java and show whether or not it was useful as more than just a highly specific language. Turned out, for the most part, OpenCL could keep up with the other two. Each language type had their own "types" of problems that they excelled at over the others, but none suffered huge penalties to solve general problems.

I'm posting this project as a whole (all three eclipse projects with their ant / make files included in folders), but without the answers file filled in. It's only the first 40 problems in Project Euler, and folks could take the code and reproduce the answer, but they'll at least have to go through that step and not just type in the answer.
