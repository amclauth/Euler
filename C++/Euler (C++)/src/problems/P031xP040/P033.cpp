/**
 * P033<br>
 * The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it
 * may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by canceling the 9s.
 * We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
 * There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing
 * two digits in the numerator and denominator.
 * If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.
 * Ans: 100

       * This problem can be reformulated as:
       * 1) ax/bx = a/b -or-
       * 2) ax/xb = a/b -or
       * 3) xa/bx = a/b -or
       * 4) xa/xb = a/b
       *
       * So instead of searching 89*89 times, we can look for solutions to these individual problems:
       *
       * 1) (10a+x)/(10b+x) = a/b => 10ab+xb = 10ab+xa => xa=xb => a=b (wrong because a must be less than b)
       * 2) (10a+x)/(10x+b) = a/b => 10ab+xb=10ax+ab => 9ab=10ax-bx => 9ab-9ax=ax-bx => 9a(b-x)=x(a-b)
       *    So since a < b, the RHS is negative, so b < x as well, so a < b < x < 10
       * 3) (10x+a)/(10b+x) = a/b => 10bx+ab=10ba+ax => 10bx-10ba=ax-ab => 9ab=10bx-ax => 9ab-9bx=bx-ax
       *    => 9b(a-x)=x(b-a), but we know that a<b, so the RHS must be positive, so a > x is implied. Also,
       *    we know that a!=x, b!=a otherwise, a=b=x, and we'd have a fraction of 1/1 which isn't allowed.
       *    => a-x=(xb-xa)/9b => a-x=xb/9b-xa/9b => a-x=x/9-xa/9b, but x can't be 9 since x < a < b < 10,
       *    so x/9 is a fraction less than 1, and with x and a both less than b and x less than 9, xa/9b
       *    is also a fraction less than 1, but that would imply a-x is a fraction. Impossible
       * 4) (10x+a)/(10x+b) = a/b => 10ax+a^2=10bx+b^2 (wrong because a must be less than b)
       *
       * So number 2 gives us the only solution.
       *
       * Continuing the solution:
       * a(b-x)=x(a-b)/9
       * LHS is an integer, so x(a-b) must be divisible by 9. Anything divisible by 9 is either a multiple of
       * 3, 6, or 9, but if x=3, then b=2 and a=1, but that doesn't create an integer on the RHS, so c must
       * be 6 or 9. With x as 6 or 9, (a-b) must be 3 or 6 (to make a multiple of 9). Let's reverse these so we
       * can deal in positives and we have:
       * a(x-b)=x(b-a)/9
       * If x is 6, b-a (where a < b < c) must be 3 and the combos can only then be b=4 a=1 and b-5 a=2, and both
       * of those obviously fit the equation.
       *
       * If x is 9, then we have a(9-b)=b-a => 9a-ab=b-a => 10a-ab=b => a=b/(10-b)
       *
       * So while we could finish this with pen and paper, those are the only things left to /compute/, so let's
       * compute them
